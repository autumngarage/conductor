## Conductor delegation

This project has [conductor](https://github.com/autumngarage/conductor)
available for delegating tasks to other LLMs from inside an agent loop.
You can shell out to it instead of trying to do everything yourself.

Pick the job type first; do not pick a provider unless the user explicitly
asks for one:

- Quick factual/background ask:
  `conductor ask --kind research --effort minimal --brief-file /tmp/brief.md`.
- Deeper synthesis/research:
  `conductor ask --kind research --effort medium --brief-file /tmp/brief.md`.
- Text/prose/docs/instructions review:
  `conductor ask --kind text-review --effort medium --brief-file /tmp/brief.md`.
- Code explanation or small coding judgment:
  `conductor ask --kind code --effort low --brief-file /tmp/brief.md`.
- Repo-changing implementation/debugging:
  `conductor ask --kind code --effort high --brief-file /tmp/brief.md`.
- Merge/PR/diff review:
  `conductor ask --kind review --base <ref> --brief-file /tmp/review.md`.
- Architecture/product judgment needing multiple views:
  `conductor ask --kind council --effort medium --brief-file /tmp/brief.md`.
- `conductor list` — show configured providers and their tags.

Conductor does not inherit your conversation context. For delegation,
write a complete brief with goal, context, scope, constraints, expected
output, and validation; use `--brief-file` for nontrivial `exec` tasks.
Default to `conductor ask`; use provider-specific `call` / `exec` only
when the user explicitly asks for a provider or the semantic API does not
fit.

Default routing is flat-rate-first when the job contract allows it, then
OpenRouter as metered overflow. `review` means code diff/PR review;
`text-review` means prose/docs/prompt review without diff tooling.
